<h2>A New Pi&ntilde;on Mouse (Peromyscus truei) from
Durango, Mexico</h2>

<h4>BY<br />
ROBERT B. FINLEY, JR.</h4>


<p>The extensive collection of Mexican mammals made by Mr. J. R.
Alcorn for the University of Kansas Museum of Natural History
contains fourteen pi&ntilde;on mice from lava rocks eight miles northeast
of the city of Durango, Mexico. These mice are all much darker
than the pi&ntilde;on mice, <i>Peromyscus truei gentilis</i>, of adjoining areas
in Durango and Zacatecas and show a superficial resemblance to
the widespread <i>P. t. gratus</i> which occurs 450 miles to the southeast.
Morphological differences from <i>P. t. gratus</i>, as well as geographic
considerations (see remarks), make desirable the recognition of the
lava-dwelling pi&ntilde;on mice from Durango as a distinct subspecies.</p>

<p>All specimens examined of subspecies compared with the series
of pi&ntilde;on mice from northeast of Durango are in the University of
Kansas Museum of Natural History. Capitalized color names and
designators are of Maerz and Paul, A Dictionary of Color, McGraw
Hill Book Co., New York, 1930.</p>

<p>I wish to acknowledge generous financial aid from the Kansas
University Endowment Association which made possible the field
work by Mr. Alcorn in Mexico.</p>

<p>This heretofore unknown subspecies is characterized below and
may be known as:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Peromyscus truei erasmus</b> subsp. nov.</p>

<p><i>Type.</i>&mdash;Mus. Nat. Hist., Univ. Kansas, no. 34417, young adult female, skin
and skull; from eight miles northeast of Durango, 6200 feet, Durango, Mexico;
collected 16 August 1949 by J. R. Alcorn, original number 10255.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i>&mdash;Known only from the type locality.</p>

<p><i>Diagnosis.</i>&mdash;Upper parts dark brownish gray (Smoke Brown, 16 A 2, to
Biskra, 16 A 12), darkest between ears; lower sides suffused with dull orange
buff (13 H 9 to 12 H 9); dark eye ring and black spot at base of vibrissae
conspicuous; ears 95 to 100 per cent as long as hind foot; bullae round, greatly
inflated; interparietal large, anterior margin curved or slightly sinuous, not
bulging strongly forward laterally; rostrum short; nasals broad; braincase high
and full; incisive foramina slightly pointed anteriorly; molars small, as in
<i>P. t. gentilis</i>.</p>

<p><i>Measurements.</i>&mdash;Measurements of 3 males and mean and extreme measurements
of 11 females, all from the type locality, are, respectively, as follows:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
total length, 192, 188 (incomplete), 196 (incomplete), 193 (188-209); length
of tail, 102, 97 (broken), 97 (broken), 101 (94-114); length of hind foot,
22, 23, 23, 22.5 (22-23); length of ear, from notch, in flesh, 21, 22, 23, 21.5
(20-23); greatest length of skull, 27.4, 27.7, 27.9, 27.3 (26.5-28.3); basilar
length, 20.2, 21.0, &mdash; (broken), 20.4 (19.6-21.2); greatest breadth of braincase,
12.8, 12.8, 13.3, 12.85 (12.4-13.4); least interorbital breadth, 4.4, 4.6,
4.6, 4.41 (4.2-4.6); length of nasals, 10.1, 10.3, 10.9, 10.3 (9.8-11.1); diastema,
6.6, 7.0, 7.1, 6.78 (6.3-7.2); length of incisive foramina, 5.6, 5.9, 6.0, 5.77
(5.5-6.0); length of palatal bridge, 3.8, 3.9, &mdash;, 3.96 (3.8-4.3); postpalatal
length, 9.9, &mdash;, &mdash;, 9.7 (9.2-10.4); alveolar length of maxillary tooth-row, 4.1,
4.1, 4.4, 4.2 (4.1-4.4). All measurements are in millimeters.</p>

<p><i>Measurements of the type.</i>&mdash;Total length, 189; length of tail, 95; length of
hind foot, 22; length of ear, from notch (in flesh), 21; greatest length of skull,
26.9; basilar length, 20.3; greatest breadth of braincase, 13.0; least interorbital
breadth, 4.4; length of nasals, 10.1; diastema, 6.6; length of incisive foramina,
5.5; length of palatal bridge, 3.9; postpalatal length, 9.8; alveolar length of
maxillary tooth-row, 4.2.</p>

<p><i>Comparisons.</i>&mdash;From <i>Peromyscus truei gentilis</i> (specimens from 5 mi. N
Durango, Durango; 4 mi. W Durango, Durango; and 8 mi. N &amp; 1 mi. W
Sombrerete, Zacatecas), the subspecies of the surrounding region, <i>P. t. erasmus</i>
differs in markedly darker coloration, sides and face less brightly washed with
orange buff, dark eye ring and spot at base of vibrissae more conspicuous,
higher incidence and greater extent of buffy pectoral spot. External measurements
do not differ significantly. No consistent cranial differences were found.</p>

<p>From <i>Peromyscus truei gratus</i> (specimens from Pedregal de los Reyes, Distrito
Federal, M&eacute;xico) to the southeast, <i>P. t. erasmus</i> differs in slightly darker
dorsal color, more inflated bullae, and less sinuous (not bulging so much forward
laterally) anterior margin of interparietal.</p>

<p>From <i>Peromyscus truei gratus</i> (specimens from various localities in eastern
Jalisco and western Michoac&aacute;n) to the south, <i>P. t. erasmus</i> differs in slightly
darker dorsal color, longer ears, and more inflated bullae.</p>

<p>From <i>Peromyscus truei truei</i> (specimens from 4 mi. N El Rito, Rio Arriba
Co., New Mexico) to the northwest, <i>P. t. erasmus</i> differs in much darker color,
shorter tail, shorter hairs on tail, smaller ears, shorter rostrum, wider nasals,
and more pointed anterior ends of incisive foramina.</p></div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;The tail of <i>P. t. erasmus</i> varies greatly in color, being
either bicolor or unicolor, dark gray above and varying from white
to dark gray below. The type has the tail dark gray above grading
gradually on the sides to medium gray below. A buffy pectoral
spot or band is present in about half of the adults examined, being
most prominent in the type, which is also one of the darkest specimens
in the series. The shape of the posterior edge of the bony
palate is also variable, being convex, square, or concave; and the
dorsal branches of the premaxillaries may terminate slightly anterior
or slightly posterior to the posterior ends of the nasals. In the type
the posterior palatal margin is concave and the dorsal branches of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
the premaxillaries almost reach the ends of the nasals. <i>Peromyscus
truei gratus</i> from Distrito Federal also shows high variability in all
these characters.</p>

<p><i>Peromyscus truei erasmus</i> is a dark race of the pi&ntilde;on mouse known
from the west side of a rough area of dark lavas a few miles northeast
of the city of Durango and closely surrounded by the light colored
race, <i>P. t. gentilis</i>, known from outside the area of lava rocks.
Specimens of <i>erasmus</i> from eight miles northeast of Durango are
all conspicuously darker than 11 specimens of <i>gentilis</i> from five
miles north of Durango and four miles west of Durango which are
typical in color for <i>gentilis</i>. Although <i>erasmus</i> more nearly resembles
in color <i>gratus</i>, in cranial characters and external measurements
it shows closer relationship to <i>gentilis</i>.</p>

<p>Alcorn reported (verbal communication) that the type series of
<i>erasmus</i> was collected on the west side of the R&iacute;o de la Saucida in
hills covered with broken lava rocks, cactus, and spiny shrubs.
Some cottonwoods grow along the river, which is almost dry most
of the time. East of the river is a flat plain or valley of adobelike
soil a few miles wide beyond which extends a rough area of dark
lavas. The approximate extent of the lava plain is indicated on
World Aeronautical Chart, Lake Santiaguillo (521). The specimens
of <i>gentilis</i> from five miles north of Durango and four miles west of
Durango were collected on slopes of adobe soil covered with grasses,
scattered junipers and low shrubs, this habitat being the lower eastern
edge of the juniper-wooded slopes that rise westward to the
Sierra Madre Occidental.</p>

<p>The available facts suggest that <i>P. t. erasmus</i> has evolved from
<i>P. t. gentilis</i> by natural selection for concealing coloration on the
dark lavas northeast of Durango, M&eacute;xico. <i>P. t. erasmus</i> probably
reaches its western limit close to the type locality.</p>
